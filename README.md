# Heroes of Newerth Mod Manager #

I like Heroes of Newerth and I wanted to improve my knowledge in Java. So during my army I started a maven project using Spring for IoC, RxJava for asynchronous operations, log4j for logging and some others libraries.

I'm developing the project then it's not ready to use at the moment.
